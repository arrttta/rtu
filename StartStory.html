            <p>You have landed in Riga - a city humming with life, however, it is not yet due to cars and buses. You are standing next to a canal and see the city center surrounded by fortifications. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You feel the urge to find out what the city is hiding inside its fortifications, but it also seems interesting to see the city from the other side of the river. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Where would you like to start your walk?
