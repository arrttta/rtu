            <h2>After wandering through the narrow streets, you end up in front of a beautiful building.</h2>
            <p>The building is decorated with sculptures and has beautiful giant windows and the doors are wide open, inviting you to come in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A man walks up to you.
                <br>
                "Crazy, isn't it? They say it's been here for centuries, and it still stands here now. The House of Black Heads has seen more than 500 years of life and many different powers."
                <br>

                <button id="lookup">Look up</button>

                    The man is still standing next to you. 
                    <br>
                    "Time flies. Things change and evolve. It should be the same in this city. It is busy with life, however, something is missing - access to knowledge. Even those who have money have to leave to become educated. The possibilities here in Riga are limited."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you turn to face the man, he is walking away from you. What knowledge was he talking about?
