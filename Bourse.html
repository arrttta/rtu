            <p> 
                As you go closer, you notice an open window. You walk past by it, and overhear a conversation from the inside.
                <br>
                <br>
                A meeting is starting inside. Multiple men are discussing seemingly recent events. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You hear them saying that the situation of the lack of specialists in Riga is to be solved in the best way possible, as a higher education institution is to be opened soon. Carl Bornhaupt is to be thanked for creating the project for the school, as well as Traugot Franke who travelled all the way from Hannover.
                <br>
                With the recently released statute of tsar Alexander II, all roads are open for a new chapter of Riga. 
                <br>
                They proudly accent how their initiative is about to become reality that once seemed so distant. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The conversations you overhear make you realise that you are standing outside the Riga Bourse and have overheard the conversations of important statesmen, including burghermeister Oto Miller.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                You continue walking further along the streets.
