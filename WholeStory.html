        <br>
        The Master Thesis "Interactive Digital Storytelling in Digital Heritage" researches using digitized heritage assets for creating interactive stories.

            <h3>It is year 1857. You have landed in Riga - a city humming with life, however, it is not yet due to cars and buses.</h3>
                <br> You are standing next to a canal and see the city center surrounded by fortifications. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You feel the urge to find out what the city is hiding inside its fortifications, but it also seems interesting to see the city from the other side of the river.

            <h3> You cross a wide river.</h3>
            <br>
            Its waves are rocking various ships and boats, showing people busy with their work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You realise that you are looking at one of the busiest points in this city - the harbour. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Boats are both loaded and empty. By looking more carefully, you can see unloading and loading of the cargo taking place in the distance. 
            <br>
            Decks of some ships are buzzing with life.

            <p>
                You see even more ships with cargo and more people working around it.
                You overhear people walking towards you on the raft bridge. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "We need more people. Everyone needs more people working for them nowadays. When I talk to traders, they also tell me how there is a lack of people who know how to handle the goods.                <br>
                <br>
                Guess we can only hope for newcomers, but how long can we work this way?"

            <h3>After wandering through the narrow streets, you end up in front of a beautiful building.</h3>
                The building is decorated with sculptures and has beautiful giant windows and the doors are wide open, inviting you to come in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A man walks up to you.
                <br>
                "Crazy, isn't it? They say it's been here for centuries, and it still stands here now. The House of Black Heads has seen more than 500 years of life and many different powers."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Time flies. Things change and evolve. It should be the same in this city. It is busy with life, however, something is missing - access to knowledge. Even those who have money have to leave to become educated. The possibilities here in Riga are limited."
                <br>
                <br>
                As you turn to face the man, he is walking away from you. What knowledge was he talking about?

        <div class="Bourse">
            <h3>A serious, big building stands in front of you.</h3>
                As you go closer, you notice an open window. You walk past by it, and overhear a conversation from the inside.
                <br>
                <br>
                A meeting is starting inside. Multiple men are discussing seemingly recent events. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You hear them saying that the situation of the lack of specialists in Riga is to be solved in the best way possible, as a higher education institution is to be opened soon. Carl Bornhaupt is to be thanked for creating the project for the school, as well as Traugot Franke who travelled all the way from Hannover.
                <br>
                With the recently released statute of tsar Alexander II, all roads are open for a new chapter of Riga. 
                <br>
                They proudly accent how their initiative is about to become reality that once seemed so distant. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The conversations you overhear make you realise that you are standing outside the Riga Bourse and have overheard the conversations of important statesmen, including burghermeister Oto Miller.
                <br>
                You continue walking further along the streets.

        <div class="Newspaper">
            <h2>You end up a street where you find a newspaper</h2>
                The first paragraph of the inland news reads as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                "The previous winter offered the public a cycle of public lectures, as had been customary for years in all major German cities. It is undoubtedly a step forward when, in addition to the demands for artistic enjoyment satisfied by theatre and concerts, the need for scientific intellectual nourishment also arises in wider circles.
                In this respect, the previous winter offered an extraordinary amount, and the numerous public, which gathered around the solid lectures of our most capable scholars in the previous autumn and winter, will certainly not fail to attend if they are offered something similar in the winter of 1862 to 1863. After all, new forces have flowed into our city in the form of the new professors of the Polytechnicum, whose work for the common good can be counted on! If it is the calling of our time to enable the whole of humanity to share in the goods of life which otherwise only individuals enjoy, then no opportunity should be missed from which one can expect progress in public education in the various areas of life. We therefore ask those men who have so successfully taken on the task of facilitating a cycle of public lectures to achieve the same for the current winter, and we do not doubt the willingness of those who are accustomed to serving the cause of the advancement of moral and intellectual education. Only where there is restless striving can success be foreseen, and with honest willing we will not fail to achieve what we are striving for."
                <br>
                <br>
                When you are done reading, you notice the same man who talked to you by the House of Black Heads.
                "Good things come to those who wait", he says. 
                "We are going to have our own university! Come, I will show you."

            <h3>The man takes you to a street corner</h3>
            <p>
                There is a large sign on the outer wall of the building that is in front of you that reads "POLYTECHNICUM"
                <br>
                <br>
                "You see, your walk was a long and meaningful one", the man besides you says. 
                <br>
                "Five years have passed since you arrived. You will soon have to leave. 
                <br>
                Riga will now be able to grow and evolve with the people who study here. The plan is to open eight departments - School of Commerce, Technical School of Chemistry, Technical School of Mechanics, School of Mechanical Engineering, School of Construction, School of Engineering, School of Land Surveying and Department of Agriculture. 
                Imagine the possibilities! Our own specialists will be able to help Riga grow. Ernst Nauk, Professor of Natural Sciences will be the director. 
                Riga Polytechnicum! Doesn't that sound noble?"
                <br>
                <br>
                You start to feel less present as if you are floating. A force is dragging you upwards...

               A large building with a tower in the roof is one of the last ones you pay attention to. The voice of the man that you have already gotten used to adds:
               <br>
               "See, this is the future of Riga Polytechnicum. It has a lot to live through and a lot to change, but I am sure that you know what it will all lead up to..."

                You know this place - you are in Ķīpsala, Riga's heart of engineering and innovation.

                <br>
                The largest Latvian university with 13327 students. 1821 of them - international students.
